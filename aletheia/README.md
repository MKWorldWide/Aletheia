# Aletheia Scaffold

This directory contains the initial scaffold for **Aletheia**, a research framework for multimodal truth evaluation.  The
structure is intentionally minimal so it can evolve over time.  Each module includes a lightweight implementation to act as a starting point for experiments.

```

Run `python run.py` to start a very small demo API.
